# Trying Up2Dep
We have cloned the source codes of [*Music Player*](https://github.com/MaxFour/Music-Player) and [*Munch*](https://github.com/crazyhitty/Munch) from their public github repos, and updated some of the outdated android framework dependencies. Other than that the repo remain untouched. 

To see how Up2Dep works with real world Android application. Please clone [up2dep](https://github.com/ngcuongst/up2dep) repository and import each project inside the sample_project folder to examine different features of Up2Dep when you open the build.gradle files.
