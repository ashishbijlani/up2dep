# up2dep

Up2Dep facilitates the task of keeping your project's library dependencies up-to-date.<br>
In comparing to Lint and/or other tools, Up2Dep is better at the following points:<br>
  - Up2Dep not only provides you information about the latest version of a dependency but also gives more insight on the compatible version if the latest version is incompatible with your code.<br>
  - With Up2Dep you can easily navigate to your API dependency and  fix it with our API change prediction.<br>
  - Up2Dep respect your privacy, it works completely offline and DOES NOT track you
